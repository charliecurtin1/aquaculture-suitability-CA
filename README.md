# West Coast Aquaculture Suitability

### Purpose

This repository contains an R markdown file that contains a workflow that takes depth and sea surface temperature rasters and outputs suitable aquaculture area for oysters in west coast exclusive economic zones. The workflow is compiled into a function that takes inputs of ideal depth and temperature ranges for any aquatic species and also returns suitable aquaculture area

### Contents

- images: contains output maps and plots from the R markdown file
- aquaculture-suitability-CA.rproj: R project file connected to git used for the workflow
- aquaculture-suitability-CA.Rmd: R markdown file containing the end-to-end workflow
- data stored locally and added to the .gitignore file
